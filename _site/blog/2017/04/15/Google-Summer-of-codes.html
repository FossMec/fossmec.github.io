            <p>Google Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. Since 2010, over 3200 students from 99 countries have completed work in the contest.</p>

<p>Because Google Code-in is often the first experience many students have with open source, the contest is designed to make it easy for students to jump right in. Open source organizations chosen by Google provide a list of tasks for students to work on during the seven week contest period. A unique part of the contest is that each task has mentors from the organization assigned should students have questions or need help along the way.</p>

<p>Open source organizations that have participated in a previous Google Code-in or Google Summer of Code program are eligible to apply to be mentor organizations for Google Code-in. Mentor organizations create hundreds of tasks for students to work on during the contest period and are responsible for assigning mentors to help students with questions and to review students’ work on the tasks.</p>

<p>Some organisations mentoring in Google Code-In</p>

<p>Zulip - https://zulip.org</p>

<p>FOSSASIA - http://fossasia.org</p>

<p>Metabrainz Foundation - https://metabrainz.org/</p>

<p>Drupal - https://www.drupal.org/     etc…</p>

<p>Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together 12,000+ student participants and 11,000 mentors from over 127 countries worldwide. Google Summer of Code has produced 30,000,000+ lines of code for 568 open source organizations.
As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in areas related to their interests and also pay $5500 for participating.</p>

<p>In turn, the participating organizations are able to identify and bring in new developers who implement new features and hopefully continue to contribute to open source even after the program is over. Most importantly, more code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.</p>
